This folder contains linux storage dumps to test linux storage algorithm.

Related unit test file: t/tasks/inventory/linux/storages.t

To generate a dump:

 1. download agent sources to a machine for which you want the dump to be included.

 2. from the sources base path, run the command:
    sudo perl -Ilib t/tasks/inventory/linux/storages.t --dump SYS-DESCRIPTION

    This will generate the resources/linux/storage/SYS-DESCRIPTION.dump with all
    the necessary for unittest and start immediatly the related tests:
     - used system file dumps
     - storage structure result
    You should set SYS-DESCRIPTION to a safe name, different from any existing
    and if possible lightly describing your system or your storage config.

    You can edit the comments at the end of the dump to limit or enhanced the
    provided information.

 4. To test again your file, just run the test file like this:
    perl -Ilib t/tasks/inventory/linux/storages.t

    If you seen any problem, you should probably open an issue on github, providing
    the generated dump and explaining the error.

 5. Don't forget to inspect the generated $STORAGE structure in the dump to verify
    all expected information are there and well-formatted.

 6. Finally you can open an issue or even a PR to have your dump(s) included.
